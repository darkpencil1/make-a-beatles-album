### Note
Logging credentials are .env variables, which are gitignored, thus you won't be able to load tracks from Spotify API without providing your own from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ . 
After you have a developer account for Spotify you need to make a project, which has spesific Client ID and Client Secret needed to get data from Spotify API.
